            As the sun set behind them, the thief and princess continued their journey through the vast Persian desert. They were both seeking something different - he, a life free from poverty and hardship, and she, an adventure beyond the palace walls.
Suddenly, a sandstorm erupted, engulfing them in a swirling cloud of dust. The thief shielded the princess from the worst of it, and together they huddled beneath a rocky outcropping for shelter. As the storm raged on, they exchanged stories of their pasts and dreams for the future.
Days turned into weeks as they journeyed deeper into the desert, each day bringing new dangers and challenges. But through it all, their bond grew stronger, with stolen glances and lingering touches hinting at the love blossoming between them.
Finally, they emerged from the desert, changed by their experiences and their love for each other. They parted ways, but never forgot the Persian nights spent together, facing the elements and falling in love slowly.

    <h2 STYLE="color:gold">THE TRIVIALITY</h2>
<pre class="verse_1">
In a kingdom of old,
A thief once stole,
But caught he was,
And banished from the fold.
</pre>
<pre class="verse_2">
Years passed by,
And the thief became a name,
Notorious and sly,
But the princess remained the same.
</pre>
<pre class="verse_3">
One day, news reached his ear,
Of the princess in danger,
He knew he had to be near,
To save her from a stranger.
</pre>
<pre class="verse_4">
He succeeded in his quest,
But was caught in the act,
The princess saw him,   
And her heart skipped a beat in fact.    
</pre>
<pre class="verse_5">
But the prince was gone,
And the kingdom was in turmoil,
The thief offered to help,
And the king agreed without a foil.
</pre>
<pre class="verse_6">
He proved his worth,
And won the hearts of all,
The thief had redeemed himself,
And the princess was enthralled.
</pre>
<pre class="verse_7">
Though she was married,
Her heart belonged to him,
And they lived happily,
Despite the odds and the grim. 
</pre>
<pre class="verse_8">
For sometimes, love finds a way,
Even in the darkest of days.
And redemption is possible,
For those who strive and are able.
</pre>
