        Learning to code is a challenging but rewarding journey that requires
        persistence and dedication. For some, coding may be a way to deal with
        rejection. By learning how to code, individuals can create something of
        their own, something that no one can take away from them. It's a way to
        express oneself and to build something that is truly unique. The process
        of coding involves trial and error, and sometimes things don't work out
        the way we want them to. However, with each failure comes a new
        opportunity to learn and improve. Through coding, individuals can
        develop a sense of resilience that can help them deal with rejection in
        other areas of their lives.
