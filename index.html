            Learning to code is a challenging
             but rewarding journey that requires 
             persistence and dedication. For some,
              coding may be a way to deal with rejection. 
              By learning how to code, individuals can
               create something of their own, something 
               that no one can take away from 
               them. It's a way to express oneself 
               and to build something that is truly 
               unique. The process of coding involves
                trial and error, and sometimes things
                 don't work out the way we want them to.
                  However, with each failure comes a new
                   opportunity to learn and improve. 
                   Through coding, individuals can
                    develop a sense of resilience that 
                    can help them deal 
            with rejection in other areas of their lives.
